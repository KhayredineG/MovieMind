# MovieMind

I've created an elegant movie recommendation system with the following features:

  1. Modern, responsive UI with smooth animations
  2. Real-time movie search using OMDB API
  3. Detailed movie information including:
     Title and year
          Poster
          Genre
          Runtime
          Plot
          IMDb rating with visual stars
          Director and cast (for main movie)
  4. Similar movie recommendations based on:
          Genre matching
          Year proximity
          Type filtering
